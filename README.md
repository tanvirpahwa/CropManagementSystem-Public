# CropManagementSystemCapstoneProject

The Crop Management System project is a capstone project for Humber College that brings the convenience of everyday farming to the 21st century. The system is designed to automatically care for crops 
and makes it easier to monitor the health of plants on your phone. This is done by using the prototype for which this app was made.
