# CropManagementSystem

The Crop Management System project is a capstone project for Humber College that brings the convenience of everyday farming to the 21st century. The system is designed to care for crops automatically 
and make it easier by monitoring the health of plants on your phone. This is done by using the prototype for which this app was made.
